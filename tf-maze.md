#TF Maze  

##Original Concept from Princess Luna, carried on by Navi Abbot after the absence of the creator.  

###Getting Started  

There are eight categories of changes:  
1. age  
2. latex  
3. anthro  
4. growth  
5. gender  
6. inanimacy  
7. feral  
8. mythic/extraterrestrial  

Players are required to change their status to inform everyone of their intent to play and to include the changes they don't want to occur to them.  

For example: ```Online: Navi's TF Maze [1,5,6]```  

###How to play  

There are six areas on the maze, each scene being different.  

In each area, there is at least one challenge that the DM will pose to the players. The players who don't mind the consequences will ```/roll 1d20```. If the roll beats the undisclosed DC, then they have solved the challenge and stay as they are. Those who fail, will fall victim to the altering consequence.  

The winner is the one who comes out of the maze the least changed!
